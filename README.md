## Prerequesites
1. [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/downloads/) (for development only)
2. [Gradle](http://gradle.org/download) (for development only)
3. [Java JDK 1.7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html)

*Final build is expected to compile into an all-in-one JAR with an embedded webserver* 

## Development Rules 
While no one really like to follow rules, let try to keep a few important ones to prevent the code base from becoming a mess

- Create a new branch when you start something new 
  * Follow the following convension 
    * feature-YourFeatureName 
    * bugfix-FeatureName-FixName
  * Create a pull request when you're done with your work and I'll merge it in if there aren't any issues
    * Please don't merge broken code
- Comment your code as much as you can 
  * Especially if you program like Yoda

## Final notes
While I sometimes like to think I'm a coding god, reality is tougher than it seems... So like everyone else, I'm learning new things everyday. And while I'm supposed to "lead" the project, I'll probably make rookie mistakes every now and then or ask stupid questions during pull request, so please be patient with me. I'll try to be smart 80% of the time.. haha... :D
